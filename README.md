# 👋 Hi there, I'm Haben Tesfamariam 

I’m a junior software engineer with a knack for solving problems and a passion for building web applications. My journey started with C and C++, but I quickly adapted to Python and JavaScript, diving deep into full-stack development. I utilize modern web technologies to create websites that look great, feel fantastic, and function correctly. I enjoy bringing ideas to life using Django for the backend and React for the frontend.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack & Skills
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework, Node.js
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, Redis
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB
- **Security & Performance**: OAuth 2.0, JWT, 2FA, Rate-Limiting, HTTPS/WSS
- **Other** Cool Stuff: WebSockets, SPA Architecture, Multi-Container Setup

## 🔥 What I’m Working On
I’m currently leveling up my React and Node.js skills while experimenting with containerized environments using Docker and Kubernetes. I’m also diving into the world of cybersecurity and infrastructure—because who doesn’t love a good challenge?

## 🎯 Goals
- Master React and Next.js for frontend development
- Get comfortable with Kubernetes and container orchestration
- Explore advanced cybersecurity techniques
